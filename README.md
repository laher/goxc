goxc
====

[goxc](http://www.laher.net.nz/goxc) cross-compiles Go programs to (up to) 9 target platforms at once.

goxc is written in Go but uses *os.exec* to call 'go build' with the appropriate flags & env variables for each supported platform.

goxc was inspired by Dave Cheney's Bash script [golang-crosscompile](https://github.com/davecheney/golang-crosscompile).
BUT, goxc crosscompiles to all platforms at once. The artifacts are saved into a folder structure along with a markdown file of relative links.

Installation
--------------
goxc requires the go source and the go toolchain.

 1. [Install go from source](http://golang.org/doc/install/source). (Requires 'hg' and gcc (or MinGW))

 2. Install goxc:

            go get github.com/laher/goxc

Basic Usage
-----------

### Run once:

To build the toolchains for all 9 platforms:

       goxc -t

### Now build your artifacts

To build binaries for your app:

       cd path/to/app/folder
       goxc .

### Going further

See 'goxc -h' for more options.

e.g. To restrict by OS and Architecture:

      goxc -os=windows -arch=amd64 .

e.g. To set a destination root folder:

      goxc -d=my/jekyll/site/downloads .

Outcome
-------

Artifacts generated into a folder structure as follows:

 (outputfolder)/(version)/(OS)_(ARCH)/(appname)(.exe?)

e.g. /my/outputfolder/latest/linux_arm/myapp

By default, the output folder is ($GOBIN)/(appname)-xc, and the version is 'latest', but you can specify these.

e.g.

      goxc -av=0.1 -d=/home/me/myapp/ghpages/downloads/ .

Limitations
-----------

 * Only tested on Linux & Windows. Please test on Mac/FreeBSD
 * Currently goxc is only designed to build standalone Go apps without linked libraries. You can try but YMMV

Todo
----

 * Artifact types: tgz, maybe packaging too (.deb/.rpm/.pkg...).
 * Automatically build target toolchain if missing? (need to work out detection mechanism)
 * 'download golang source' option (if it's not there)?
 * building .so/.dll shared libraries?
